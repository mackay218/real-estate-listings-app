# real-estate-listings-app

This is an app to resemble a Real Estate website to add new listings and show existing lisitings of properties for rent and for sale.  The listings use a set of default photos. Listings can also be deleted and searched.  

The purpose of this poject is to practice routes and SQL queries to a database using postgres and displaying the results on the DOM via AngularJS.
